Creating an inclusive platform for the differently-abled, our mission at the hackathon is to empower and support this community, ensuring they have access to opportunities and experiences that enrich their lives. We are committed to building a more inclusive world by:

1. Compiling a comprehensive list of job opportunities tailored to the abilities and needs of the differently-abled, promoting financial independence.
2. Providing a curated list of safe tourist spots in India, including religious sites and beaches, that have made adjustments to accommodate individuals with disabilities. We also facilitate connections with travel buddies who can accompany them.
3. Offering information about nearby hospitals, pharmacies, specialized equipment suppliers, and volunteers within a specific radius, ensuring access to essential services and support networks.
4. Listing emergency medical service helpline numbers for quick assistance during emergencies.
5. Highlighting various government schemes and provisions designed to support individuals with disabilities, ensuring they are aware of their rights and entitlements.
6. Connecting users with nearby non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to serving the differently-abled, fostering a supportive community and providing access to additional resources.
7. Featuring a dedicated blog section where individuals can share their stories, experiences, and insights, fostering an inclusive community and raising awareness about disability issues.

Through this hackathon, we aim to harness the power of technology to break down barriers and create a more inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can thrive.
